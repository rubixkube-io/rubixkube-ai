**Transforming Kubernetes Security with AI-Powered Supply Chain Intelligence**

RubixKube is the next-generation platform that revolutionizes how organizations secure their Kubernetes environments through advanced supply chain risk intelligence (SRI). By combining cutting-edge AI with deep Kubernetes expertise, we provide unparalleled visibility and protection for your containerized infrastructure.

## üõ°Ô∏è What is RubixKube?

RubixKube addresses the critical security challenges facing modern cloud-native organizations:

- **Supply Chain Visibility**: Complete transparency into your container supply chain
- **AI-Powered Risk Assessment**: Machine learning algorithms that identify threats before they impact your infrastructure
- **Kubernetes-Native Security**: Purpose-built for container orchestration environments
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time protection that scales with your operations

## üéØ Why RubixKube?

### Comprehensive Security Coverage
Traditional security tools weren't designed for the complexity of modern Kubernetes environments. RubixKube provides:

- **End-to-end Supply Chain Analysis**: From code commit to production deployment
- **Behavioral Anomaly Detection**: AI that learns your normal patterns and identifies deviations
- **Policy-as-Code Integration**: Security policies that evolve with your infrastructure
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify across your entire stack

### Built for Modern DevOps
Seamlessly integrate security into your existing workflows:

- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: Security checks embedded in your development process
- **Developer-Friendly Tools**: Security that enhances rather than hinders productivity
- **Automated Remediation**: AI-powered responses to common security scenarios
- **Compliance Automation**: Continuous compliance monitoring and reporting

## üîç Key Features
