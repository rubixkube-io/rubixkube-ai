<h1>RubixKube</h1>
<p><strong>Site Reliability Intelligence for the AI Era</strong></p>


RubixKube is the reliability brain for modern systems. An AI-native mesh of agents that watch, plan, act, and learn — 24/7. Keep revenue online. RubixKube watches your stack, finds the real cause, and fixes it safely with approvals.

## 🎯 What is Site Reliability Intelligence?

Site Reliability Intelligence (SRI) uses agents, context, and memory to detect, diagnose, and heal issues across your stack. It closes the Observe → Plan → Act → Learn loop and turns RCAs into reusable knowledge.

### Key Capabilities:
- **Detect, diagnose, and heal** before customers feel it
- **Human-in-the-loop guardrails** for safe autonomous operations
- **Works with Kubernetes, cloud, and your tools** through intelligent integrations
- **Continuous learning** from every incident and resolution

## 🚀 Why Choose RubixKube?

### Unify Operations in One Command Center
- **One command center**: Unify incidents, signals, and actions in one place
- **Predict and prevent**: Catch risky rollouts and regressions early
- **De-risk deployments**: Plan safe rollbacks and patches with context
- **MTTR that actually drops**: Correlate signals to evidence. No alert fatigue
- **Protect revenue and trust**: SLOs stay green. Customers stay happy

### Built for Modern Engineering Teams
RubixKube transforms operations from firefighting to foresight:

- **AI-Powered Analytics**: Machine learning models trained on global infrastructure patterns
- **Conversational Control**: Manage clusters and apps through chat, CLI, or web with natural language
- **Smart Agent Operations**: Agents detect incidents, triage root cause, and propose fixes with evidence
- **Evolving Memory**: Snapshot and historical memory improve every decision and RCA

## 🔍 How Site Reliability Intelligence Works

### The SRI Process: Observe → Plan → Act → Learn

1. **Observe**: Continuously maps your infra across Kubernetes, cloud, code, and configs. Pulls context from Prometheus, Loki, GitHub, and more
2. **Plan**: Agents reason over live data and history to propose safe, auditable actions
3. **Act**: Execute fixes behind guardrails. Approve PRs or apply controlled changes with policy checks
4. **Learn**: Every incident updates memory and playbooks. RCAs become knowledge, not documents you forget

### Core Platform Features

#### 🤖 Intelligent Agent Mesh
- **Modular Agents**: Observer, Planner, Executor, Historian, Collaborator — each focused on their specialty
- **Agent Mesh**: Specialized agents coordinate across your stack to investigate and remediate faster
- **Distributed Coordination**: Goal-oriented agent collaboration ensures cohesive action across complex operations

#### 🧠 Multi-Dimensional Memory System  
- **Evolving Memory**: Snapshot and historical memory improve every decision and RCA
- **Evidence-Linked RCA**: Timelines, queries, diffs, and actions captured automatically and shared with teams
- **Context Enrichment**: CI/CD metadata, architecture docs, FAQs, support tickets automatically linked to infrastructure nodes

#### 🛡️ Governed Autonomy Framework
- **Guardrails and Approvals**: Least-privilege actions, policy checks, and human approvals when you want them
- **Visual RCA Flow**: Infrastructure graph animates investigation paths and remediation steps in real time
- **Conversational Control**: Manage clusters and apps through chat, CLI, or web. Natural language with real action

## 🎯 What RubixKube Handles

### Incident Response & Resolution
**Incidents that finish themselves** — agents correlate signals, pinpoint root cause, and apply safe fixes
- Auto-triage and correlation across logs, metrics, traces
- Proposed fixes with risk and blast radius assessment
- MTTR reduced by 80%, on-call stress down
- Eliminate alert fatigue with intelligent correlation

### Release Reliability & Deployment Safety
**Safe launches, always** — validates deployments and automatically rolls back at the first sign of risk
- Detect bad rollouts right after deploy
- Rollback or patch with context and approvals
- Protect customer experience during releases
- Zero-downtime deployments with health monitoring

### Cost & Performance Optimization
**Capacity without chaos** — continuously optimizes resources before they bottleneck
- Spot regressions and noisy neighbors
- Right-size workloads with evidence-based recommendations
- Keep SLOs and budgets in line
- Predict capacity needs before issues arise

### Compliance & Audit
**SOC-friendly by design** — comprehensive audit trails and policy enforcement
- Action logs, RCAs, and policies in one place
- Prove who did what and why with complete audit trails
- Automated compliance for SOC 2, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and more
- Evidence-linked documentation for regulatory requirements
